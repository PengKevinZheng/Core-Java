OOP

OOP properties: 

1. encapsulation

Encapsulation is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods. 

If a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class. 

2. inheritance

3. polymorohism

4. abstraction
